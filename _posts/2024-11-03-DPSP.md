### Project Overview

A project I worked on during the course **CS4505 - Software Architecture** at TU Delft. We were tasked with identifying a problem and designing a software solution to address it. My team and I chose to focus on the lack of transparency in parliamentary proceedings, which often leads to a disconnect between citizens and their elected representatives. We aimed to create a digital platform that would allow citizens to easily access and engage with parliamentary sessions, by providing information about the session, the agenda, the current speaker, as well as the topic being discussed. Our platform also aims to provide real-time transcripts of the sessions, allowing citizens to follow along and understand the discussions taking place.

### Architecture Overview

We based our architecture on a microservices approach, which allows us to scale the platform easily and maintain a clear separation of concerns. Our architecture choice also allows us to deploy each service independently, which is crucial for a platform that needs to be highly available and responsive. To facilitate this, we used Docker to containerize our services, and Kafka for communication between them. This allows us to decouple our services and ensure that they can communicate with each other in a reliable and efficient manner.

Thus, we ended up with a microservices architecture, with some sprinkles of publish-subscribe messaging via Kafka and event-driven design. The architecture is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing us to add new features and services in the future.

While our architecture design was extensive, we only implemented a subset of the services, focusing on the core functionality of the platform. 

The services we implemented include:

- **Video Processing Service**: This service is responsible for processing the video streams from the parliamentary sessions, extracting the audio and video data, and storing it in a format that can be easily accessed by the other services.
- **Transcription Service**: Generates real-time transcripts of the parliamentary sessions, via OpenAI's Whisper model.
- **Gateway Service**: This service acts as the entry point to the platform, handling subscription to different data streams, and providing a unified API for the other services to interact with.

### Transcription Service

Aside from my involvement in the architecture design, I was responsible for implementing the Transcription Service. This service consists of a Rust-based backend that subscribes to the audio stream, collects audio chunks from the Kafka topic, and processes them through Whisper to generate real-time transcripts, which are then published to another Kafka topic to be further consumed. 

The service is designed in a straightforward, yet modular manner, allowing for easy replacement of the transcription model in the future.
